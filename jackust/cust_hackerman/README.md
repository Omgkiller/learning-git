  We have used flutter sdk and dart as our main language, with amazon AWS as our database, using php as our linkage.
  Currently, we only developed the UI, display of information and the image searching function due to the limited time.
  
  main.dart only list the initial home page
  
  routegenerator.dart organise all the page routes
  
  The foodtemplate_2.dart is the major UI of the whole app
  
  
  foodcard.dart shows the "card" face of the food, where the "more" button helps navigate to the food page (currently foodtemplate2.dart), will modify later
